### Styling text:

 This is <sub>megiee</sub> 

 She is _6_ years old

 Apparently, she is a cat with *character*.
 In the eye of megiee, I am an __well-trained__ staff that provide food for her.

 I am a junior year student, and I am interested in database and machine learning.

 I am work with Prof. Ousterhout’s research team on *Analyzing the Usability of Systems for Querying “Eclectic” Data*
